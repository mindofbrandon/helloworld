# Project 1: Multi-Process Programming
Authors: Brandon Zuniga, Bob The Builder, John Smith 

Project 1 is the first project for Operating Systems to review fundamentals of multiprocessing.

This program will:
1. Generate multiple processes using the UNIX fork() function
2. Handle their return using wait()
3. Generate output from both parent and child processes to demonstrate the correctness of your approach.

Notes: 
* The program was built and ran in CLion, including the makefiles
* The program was tested on Ubuntu 20 and 18.04
* CMakeLists.txt required `target_link_libraries(test2 m)` to run `sqrt` function in test case 2
* CMake 3.10 or higher is required.
## Installation
1. Unzip the archive file and extract the contents into a folder in a directory of your choosing.

# Running The Program
## If makefile already exists upon installation:

1. Open up your terminal console of choice (stable version uses Ubuntu 18's MATE Terminal or Ubuntu 20 with terminator).
2. Change directory to the folder where the files are located (`cd Directory/folder/PROJECTLOCATION`
3. Change directory to /cmake-build-debug `cd /cmake-build-debug`
4. Type `./proj1 x` where x is the number of child processes desired to run the program. (NOTE: The maximum number of child processes is 25)
## If you need to create a makefile upon installation:

1. Open up your terminal console of choice (stable version uses Ubuntu 18's MATE Terminal or Ubuntu 20 with terminator).
2. Change directory to the folder where the files are located (`cd Directory/folder/PROJECTLOCATION`).
3. Change directory to /cmake-build `cd /cmake-build`
4. Create the makefile from terminal by running `cmake .. -G"Unix Makefiles"`
5. Once build files have been written, type `make` into your terminal to compile the program.
6. Type `./proj1 x` where x is the number of child processes desired to run the program. (NOTE: The maximum number of child processes is 25)
7. When finished with program, type `make clean` to remove the object files from the folder.
